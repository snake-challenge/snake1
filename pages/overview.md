# Overview

The SNAKE (SaNitization Algorithm under attacK ...ε) challenge focuses on membership inference attacks on differentially-private synthetic data generation algorithms. 

**Input.** We provide to the attack algorithms the following information:
• The synthetic dataset generated by an execution of the targeted sanitization algorithm over a
private dataset.
• The base dataset from which the private dataset is sampled.
• The parameters of the execution of the sanitization algorithm attacked.

**Output.** The output of the attack algorithm is a single real ∈ [0, 1] indicating the predicted probability of each target being within the private dataset or not.
